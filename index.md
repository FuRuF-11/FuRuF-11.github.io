Welcome to my website!  
I am now working on my PhD degree in HKBU under the supervision of  [Prof. Ma Jing](https://majingcuhk.github.io/).  
My research interests are mainly constructed on NLP, Reinforcement Learning and [Algorithmic Information Theory](http://www.hutter1.net/ait.htm#ray).

Specifically, I am now trying to figure out how to scale the [test-time compute](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/blogpost-scaling-test-time-compute)(AKA, T.T.C.) efficiently.

And I believe that DL is the key to achieve AGI, and AIT will provide real theoretical support for DL. One day, we will use AI to eliminate all ignorance and usher in a golden age for mankind.

If you want contact with me, please just send me an e-mail.
