Welcome to my website!  
<!-- I am now working on my AI PhD degree in HKBU under the supervision of Professor [Ma Jing.](https://majingcuhk.github.io/)-->
My research interests are mainly constructed on NLP, reinforcement learning and [Algorithmic information theory](http://www.hutter1.net/ait.htm#ray).

And I believe that deep learning is the key to achieve AGI, and AIT will provide real theoretical support for DL.

If you want contact with me, please just send me an e-mail.
