Welcome to my website!  
I am now working on my PhD degree in HKBU under the supervision of Professor [Ma Jing](https://majingcuhk.github.io/).  
My research interests are mainly constructed on NLP, reinforcement learning and [Algorithmic information theory](http://www.hutter1.net/ait.htm#ray).

In particular, I am studying the [test-time compute](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/blogpost-scaling-test-time-compute)(AKA, TTC)

And I believe that deep learning is the key to achieve AGI, and AIT will provide real theoretical support for DL. One day, we will use AI to eliminate all ignorance and usher in a golden age for mankind.

If you want contact with me, please just send me an e-mail.
